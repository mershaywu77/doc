# SHARED vs MODULE
The difference is that you can link to a SHARED library with the linker, but you cannot link to a MODULE with the linker. On some platforms.    
So... to be fully cross-platform and work everywhere CMake works, you should never do this:    
## This is a big NO-NO:
```
add_library(mylib MODULE ${srcs})
target_link_libraries(myexe mylib)
```
To be fair, on Windows, they're both just dlls, and so this code might actually work. But when you take it to a platform where it's impossible to link to the MODULE, you'll encounter an error.        
Bottom line: if you need to link to the library, use SHARED. If you are guaranteed that the library will only be loaded dynamically, then it's safe to use a MODULE. (And perhaps even preferable to help detect if somebody does try to link to it...)

# Enable gprof
Compile your program to enable prof    
`cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-pg -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg <SOURCE_DIR>`    
Make sure you program will return or exit (not abort)   
Run the application normal   
`gprof options executable-file gmon.out bb-data [yet-more-profile-data-filesâ€¦] [> outfile]  `      

# Passing compiler options to cmake in command line
`cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="" your_path_of_cmake_file`    

e.g. preprocess only
`cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-E" your_path_of_cmake_file`
