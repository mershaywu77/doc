# 1588 in Process Bus
1PPS signal for 300-400m will need 2 us propagation delay.   
Propagation speed and delay   
Optical cables transfer data at the speed of light in glass (slower than vacuum). This is typically around 180,000 to 200,000 km/s, resulting in 5.0 to 5.5 microseconds of latency per km. Thus the round-trip delay time for 1000 km is around 11 milliseconds.[17]
